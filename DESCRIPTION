Description: A program that analyzes multiple "omics" datasets, such as
    RNA-Seq, whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, ATAC-Seq, proteomics, and metabolomics.
    Dataset types are combined to improve the power of detecting enriched pathways, especially
    small pathways. Dataset types are also combined to identify changes that are compensatory
    with regard to direct downstream changes.
